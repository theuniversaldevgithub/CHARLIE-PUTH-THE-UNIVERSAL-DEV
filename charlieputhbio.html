						<h2><a href="#">CHARLIE PUTH</a></h2>
						<p>
							Charles Otto Puth Jr. (born December 2, 1991) is an American singer, songwriter, and

							videos uploaded to YouTube.

							<h3><b>Voicenotes</b></h3>
						</header>
						<p>
							Over the past three years, Charlie Puth has proven himself commercially with the
							extraordinary success of four
							multi-platinum hits, "One Call Away," "Marvin Gaye," and "We Don’t Talk Anymore" from his
							platinum-selling, Top 10
							debut album Nine Track Mind, as well as his breakout hit "See You Again" — the best-selling
							song of 2015 worldwide
							that spent 12 weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100, earned him three Grammy nominations
							(including Song of the Year),
							a Golden Globe nomination, and 9x-platinum certification in the U.S. But the New Jersey-born
							singer, songwriter,
							musician, and producer was also eager to prove himself artistically when it came time to
							make his second album,
							Voicenotes, named after the trusty iPhone app he uses to collect his musical ideas. Puth
							co-wrote every song and
							recorded and produced the album entirely himself (barring one song he co-produced with Max
							Martin) mainly at his
							home studio in Los Angeles.
							<br>
							A meticulously crafted game-changer replete with sparkling melodies and sleek, danceable
							grooves, Voicenotes
							decimates everything people may think they know about this musical polymath, who has not
							only written and produced
							his own massive hits, but also for other artists spanning a range of genres, including Jason
							Derulo, Trey Songz,
							Thomas Rhett, Maroon 5, and G-Eazy. On Voicenotes, Puth allows himself to truly be seen, not
							only as an artist but
							also as a human, which meant stepping out from behind the detached façade of lovelorn
							balladeering and being
							transparent about his emotions and influences.
							<br>
							On the lyrical front, Voicenotes is an album that is largely about Puth’s struggle to find a
							normal relationship
							when his own life has hardly been normal since finding multiplatinum success, and the
							anxiety that pursuit has
							induced. "I wanted it to be a story of my travels from the East Coast to the West Coast and
							how my growing fame
							has affected my mind in good and bad ways," he says. The first three singles — "Attention,"
							"How Long," and "Done
							For Me" featuring Kehlani — cover that territory. "Whenever I met anybody, they often knew
							more about me than I
							knew about myself," he says. "I’d never dealt with anything like that before." Songs like
							"LA Girls," "Like A
							Boy," and "Slow It Down" detail different aspects of the rarified life of someone who feels
							like he should be
							enjoying the glittering lifestyle of fabulous parties and ample romantic opportunities, but
							just doesn’t —
							something Puth addresses on self-acceptance anthem "The Way I Am," which opens with the
							following lines: "Maybe
							I’m a get a little anxious / Maybe I’m a get a little shy / Cuz everybody’s trying to be
							famous / And I’m just
							trying to find a place to hide").
							<br>
							"I thought I was supposed to go to all these parties and be this type of person so I’ve
							always shoved my anxiety
							under the carpet because I didn’t think anyone cared to hear about it," he says. “This album
							touches on that, but
							I also wanted to make sure that these songs, at the end of the day, are fun because some
							people choose not to
							listen to the lyrics. They just want to go to the club, listen to the beat, and have a great
							time. And that’s
							totally fine, too."
							<br>
							To achieve his goal of making people want to “dance and cry at the same time,” Puth allowed
							his love for jazz and
							late ’80s/early ’90s R&B to shine through, which upped the music’s sophistication level
							several notches.
							Voicenotes’ up-tempo, groove-minded songs like “Attention," “How Long," “Done For Me," and
							"The Way I Am" are so
							effortlessly catchy that they seem simple on the surface, but are hardly that. Puth, whose
							perfect pitch means he
							is often distracted by identifying the notes sounded by passing car horns and leaf-blowers,
							began studying jazz at
							age 10 and attended both the Manhattan School of Music Pre-College, where he majored in jazz
							piano, and Berklee
							College of Music, where he graduated with a degree in music production and engineering. His
							classical training is
							on full display, along with his impeccable influences — which range from jazz greats Miles
							Davis, John Coltrane,
							and Bill Evans to R&B songwriter-producers Babyface, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, and Teddy
							Riley.
							<br>
							"I was influenced by artists who were proving something when they broke off from their
							groups," Puth says, citing
							Bobby Brown and Ralph Tresvant after New Edition, Steve Perry after Journey, and George
							Michael after Wham!. "When
							George left Wham! he wanted to show the world that he could produce records like ‘Careless
							Whisper’ and ‘Father
							Figure’ on his own," Puth says. "He didn’t do it in vengeful way. He was just showing people
							how musical he was.
							That was really my goal as well." Puth’s musical heroes turn up on two of Voicenotes’
							tracks, "If You Leave Me
							Now," featuring Boys II Men ("What they sent me was perfect; it was the first time I didn’t
							have to do anything to
							finish a song") and "Change," featuring his idol James Taylor ("I never thought I’d be able
							to do a song with him
							and when I met him, it confirmed in my mind that I want to have a career just like his").
							<br>
							Audiences have embraced Puth’s bold new direction. "Attention,” which the New York Times pop
							critic Jon Caramanica
							listed fourth on his year-end list of "Best Songs of 2017," climbed to No. 5 on the
							Billboard Hot 100 (Puth’s
							highest-charting single as a solo artist), hit No. 1 on both the Top 40 and Hot AC radio
							charts, and his been
							certified double-platinum, while the funky, cheating-ex song "How Long" hit No. 3 at Top 40
							radio and has been
							certified platinum.
							<br>
							For all of his success, Puth still sees himself as the kid from Rumson who played organ in
							church and made
							mixtapes for the girls at school. "I still have the same deep infatuation with chord
							changes, girls, and food,” he
							says. "Nothing’s really changed. I still find myself to be a pretty humble guy. Every room I
							walk into I think I’m
							the worst songwriter and I have to prove myself. But it’s because of that that I get
							better.” Over the past three years, Charlie Puth has proven himself commercially with the
							extraordinary success of four
