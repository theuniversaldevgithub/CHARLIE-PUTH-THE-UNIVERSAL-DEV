						<p>
							Charles Otto Puth Jr. (born December 2, 1991) is an American singer, songwriter, and
							record producer. His initial exposure came through the viral success of his song
							videos uploaded to YouTube.

							<h3><b style="color: white; padding: 20px;">Biography</b></h3>
						</header>
						<p style="padding: 20px;">

							Over the past three years, Charlie Puth has proven himself commercially with the
							extraordinary success of four multi-platinum hits, “One Call Away,” “Marvin Gaye,” and “We
							Don’t Talk Anymore” from his platinum-selling, Top 10 debut album Nine Track Mind, as well
							as his breakout hit “See You Again” — the best-selling song of 2015 worldwide that spent 12
							weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100, earned him three Grammy nominations (including Song of the
							Year), a Golden Globe nomination, and 9x-platinum certification in the U.S. But the New
							Jersey-born singer, songwriter, musician, and producer was also eager to prove himself
							artistically when it came time to make his second album, Voicenotes, named after the trusty
							iPhone app he uses to collect his musical ideas. Puth co-wrote every song and recorded and
							produced the album entirely himself (barring one song he co- produced with Max Martin)
							mainly at his home studio in Los Angeles.
							<br>

							A meticulously crafted game-changer replete with sparkling melodies and sleek, danceable
							grooves, Voicenotes decimates everything people may think they know about this musical
							polymath, who has not only written and produced his own massive hits, but also for other
							artists spanning a range of genres, including Jason Derulo, Trey Songz, Thomas Rhett, Maroon
							5, and G-Eazy. On Voicenotes, Puth allows himself to truly be seen, not only as an artist
							but also as a human, which meant stepping out from behind the detached façade of lovelorn
							balladeering and being transparent about his emotions and influences.
							<br>

							On the lyrical front, Voicenotes is an album that is largely about Puth’s struggle to find a
							normal relationship when his own life has hardly been normal since finding multiplatinum
							success, and the anxiety that pursuit has induced. “I wanted it to be a story of my travels
							from the East Coast to the West Coast and how my growing fame has affected my mind in good
							and bad ways,” he says. The first three singles — “Attention,” “How Long,” and “Done For Me”
							featuring Kehlani — cover that territory. “Whenever I met anybody, they often knew more
							about me than I knew about myself,” he says. “I’d never dealt with anything like that
							before.” Songs like “LA Girls,” “Like A Boy,” and “Slow It Down” detail different aspects of
							the rarified life of someone who feels like he should be enjoying the glittering lifestyle
							of fabulous parties and ample romantic opportunities, but just doesn’t — something Puth
							addresses on self-acceptance anthem “The Way I Am,” which opens with the following lines:
							“Maybe I’m a get a little anxious / Maybe I’m a get a little shy / Cuz everybody’s trying to
							be famous / And I’m just trying to find a place to hide”).
							<br>

							“I thought I was supposed to go to all these parties and be this type of person so I’ve
							always shoved my anxiety under the carpet because I didn’t think anyone cared to hear about
							it,” he says. “This album touches on that, but I also wanted to make sure that these songs,
							at the end of the day, are fun because some people choose not to listen to the lyrics. They
							just want to go to the club, listen to the beat, and have a great time. And that’s totally
							fine, too.”
